I did a project to create a heatmap showing flood prone areas and risk based on the data we collected from the residence of the township of Washington.

Here is the code I made from folium and converted to HTML. Write a .md file for my github repo:

# Flood Risk Heatmap for Washington Township

This project visualizes flood-prone areas and calculates flood risk based on data collected from the residents of Washington Township. The heatmap displays normalized risk scores for various streets, offering an intuitive representation of potential flood hazards.

## Project Overview

The flood risk is calculated as:

Risk = Probability of Flooding × Damage in Dollars

markdown
Copy code

The risk values were normalized based on survey responses from residents across different streets in the township. The resulting heatmap provides a visual representation of the flood-prone areas with varying levels of risk.

### Features

- **Interactive Heatmap**: Displays the risk levels for different streets based on normalized scores.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily locate specific streets using the search feature.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over points to view detailed street-specific information, including:
  - Street Name
  - Risk Score
  - Total Respondents
- **Full-Screen Support**: Expand the map to full-screen mode for better visualization.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Used for data processing and generating the map using the `folium` library.
- **Folium**: Leveraged to create an interactive Leaflet-based heatmap.
- **HTML & JavaScript**: Used for rendering the map in a browser and adding interactivity.
- **Leaflet Plugins**:
  - `Leaflet.heat` for the heatmap layer.
  - `Leaflet.Search` for search functionality.
  - `Leaflet.Fullscreen` for full-screen support.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Interact with the heatmap:
   - Pan and zoom to explore different areas.
   - Use the search bar to find specific streets.
   - Hover over points to view detailed flood risk data.

### Normalized Risk Data

The risk values are calculated and normalized based on:
- Number of respondents
- Reported probability of flooding
- Estimated damage in dollars

## Data Sources

Data was collected via a community survey conducted with the residents of Washington Township. The responses were processed to calculate street-specific flood risks.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flood-risk-heatmap.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash

What is tooltip?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A tooltip is a small, interactive pop-up box that appears when a user hovers over or clicks on an element (like a point on a map, button, or image). Tooltips are used to provide additional information or context about the element without cluttering the main interface.

Characteristics of a Tooltip:
Trigger: Usually triggered by hover or click actions.
Content: Displays concise, contextual information such as labels, descriptions, or data points.
Positioning: Often positioned near the element being interacted with.
Transient: It disappears when the user moves away from the element.
Example in a Map Context:
In your flood risk heatmap:

When a user hovers over a point (representing a street), a tooltip might display:
Street Name
Normalized Risk Factor
Total Respondents
This makes the map interactive and informative without overwhelming users with too much visible data at once.

Should my repos show quantity or quality?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your repositories should prioritize quality over quantity, especially if you want to make an impact or stand out in a professional or academic setting. However, a balance between the two is ideal. Here’s why focusing on quality is more important:

Why Focus on Quality?
Demonstrates Mastery:

A few high-quality projects show that you deeply understand your field and can deliver meaningful, well-crafted solutions.
Employers, collaborators, or peers are more likely to trust your work if it demonstrates high standards.
Engages Viewers:

Thoughtful, well-documented repositories with clear code, useful features, and polished README files attract attention and showcase professionalism.
Reflects Your Expertise:

A high-quality project with clean code, tests, and documentation reflects your ability to produce production-ready work.
Better Use of Resources:

It’s better to refine a few meaningful projects than scatter your focus across many incomplete or trivial ones.
When Does Quantity Matter?
Breadth of Skills: If you’re early in your journey and exploring different tools, languages, or domains, a diverse set of small repositories can showcase curiosity and breadth.
Portfolio Diversity: Multiple repositories can demonstrate versatility, especially if they span different areas like data science, web development, or AI.
Learning Showcase: If you’re documenting learning paths, small, focused repositories on specific techniques (e.g., algorithms or APIs) can be valuable.
Best Practices for Repos:
For Quality:

Well-documented with a comprehensive README.md.
Include real-world use cases or demo links.
Have modular, clean, and maintainable code.
Use version control effectively with clear commit messages.
Include tests (if relevant).
For Quantity Without Sacrificing Quality:

Publish polished iterations of small projects.
Remove or archive repositories that don’t add value.
Use templates to streamline repo organization and documentation.
What Should Your Repo Balance Look Like?
If you’re early in your career, focus on a mix: build a few standout projects while maintaining smaller ones that showcase learning.
If you’re advancing, aim for fewer but more impactful repositories that can serve as portfolio highlights.
In summary: quality makes a stronger impression, but quantity with intentionality can help tell the story of your growth and versatility.

# YouTube Transcript Question-Answering Using LangChain

This project enables users to query a YouTube video transcript and receive detailed, context-aware responses using LangChain. By leveraging OpenAI's embeddings and large language models, it creates a vector database from a video's transcript and retrieves relevant information for queries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. **Load YouTube Transcripts**: Extract transcript data from a YouTube video.
2. **Create a Vector Database**: Process the transcript into smaller chunks and store it in a FAISS-based vector database.
3. **Answer Questions**: Use a language model to provide detailed, accurate answers to user queries based on the transcript.

## Features

- **YouTube Loader**: Automatically fetches the transcript of a YouTube video using its URL.
- **Vector Database**: Stores and retrieves relevant transcript sections using FAISS.
- **Query Processing**: Answers questions using only factual information from the transcript.
- **Error Handling**: Returns "I don't know" if insufficient information is available in the transcript.

## Dependencies

- `langchain_community`
- `langchain`
- `langchain_openai`
- `faiss`
- `dotenv`
- `OpenAI API`
